## Syllabot - AI Syllabus Assistant for Students

Agents (Claude, Gemini, etc....) configured to load the course context including the schedule, materials, and assignments as they are posted. Follow the instructions in Course Information and ask:

- "What's the next assignment due?"
- "Explain the Master Theorem"
- "Help me implement Dijkstra's algorithm"
- "What topics are on Exam 1?"

Programming Assignments are intended to be completed based on the provided course material and in-class lectures. Remember AI makes mistakes and can only accomplish what you can describe. Use algorithms for learning at your own risk.

2. **Algorithmic Design Paradigms** - Design efficient algorithms using divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming paradigms, including recursive problem decomposition and correctness proofs
3. **Data Structure Implementation and Analysis** - Implement and analyze fundamental data structures (BSTs, heaps, hash tables, graphs) with deep understanding of their operations, complexities, and appropriate use cases
4. **Computational Complexity Theory** - Understand computational complexity theory including P, NP, and NP-completeness classifications, and classify problems by their computational difficulty with reduction techniques
5. **Real-World Problem Solving** - Apply algorithmic thinking to solve complex real-world computational problems, selecting appropriate algorithms and data structures for given constraints and requirements
6. **Graph Algorithm Proficiency** - Implement and analyze graph algorithms (BFS, DFS, shortest paths, MST) with comprehensive understanding of graph representations and algorithmic applications
7. **Advanced Optimization Techniques** - Master greedy algorithm design and dynamic programming approaches to optimization problems, recognizing when each paradigm is optimal and understanding correctness proofs
