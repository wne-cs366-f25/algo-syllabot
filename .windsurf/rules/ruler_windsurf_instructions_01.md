- BiWeekly programming assignments due every other Thursday at 11:59 PM
- Starter Code Available either in Java or Python for PA1-PA6; Students may choose either language and switch between assignments
- Solutions posted Wednesday morning
- Late policy: 10% deduction per day, max 5 days late
- Focus on implementation of different algorithmic paradigms
- Programming assignments (PA0-PA6) are privately accessible through GitHub Classroom
- Access requires GitHub usernames to be cross-posted to GitHub Classroom (completed morning of Aug 28th)
- Contact instructor if username unavailable in GitHub Classroom

## Important Links and Resources

- **GitHub**: Create a GitHub account to complete Programming Assignments
- **Discord**: Join the [Course Discord Server](https://discord.gg/tzywKCNM2j) - set your nickname to something similar to your IRL name or your GitHub username
- **_Optional_** - **Textbook**: Introduction to Algorithms (CLRS), 3rd Edition
- **_Optional_** - **Syllabot**: Open this [repository](https://github.com/wne-cs366-f25/algo-syllabot.git) as a devContainer in VSCode and start your prefered AI agent
- **Lecture Transcripts**: Anonymized transcripts of class lectures are posted to Kodiak LMS to enhance accessibility

## Repository Structure

```

**Key Notes**

- Lesson files for each exam unit will be posted by the instructor as the course progresses
- Files are posted by the instructor usually on the morning of each lecture
- Programming assignments are separately accessible on GitHub Classroom (PA0-PA6)

### Why This Structure Matters for Students and Assistants

**Progressive Learning Path**: Each exam folder builds on previous concepts, allowing students to develop algorithmic maturity gradually. Agents can reference this progression when explaining how concepts connect.

**Comprehensive Context**: This file provides complete course context including:

- Current semester dates and deadlines
- Programming assignment specifications and due dates
- Office hours and contact information
- Course policies and academic integrity guidelines
- Links to GitHub Classroom and Discord resources

**Intelligent Assistance**: When students interact with Syllabot the AI can:

- Check current dates against the course schedule
- Recommend relevant materials based on upcoming exams
- Provide direct links to specific lesson files in this repository
- Offer programming help aligned with course learning objectives
- Answer questions about course policies and procedures

## Programming

1. Each exam folder contains lesson materials organized by topic (once theyre posted by the Instructor usually morning of the lecture)
2. Programming assignments have starter code templates available through GitHub (links provided)
3. Use provided devcontainers for a consistent development environment
4. All code should be tested before submission
