## Assessment

- **Algorithm Analysis and Foundations**: 15%
- **Advanced Data Structures**: 15%
- **Dynamic Programming and Computational Complexity**: 15%
- **Programming Assignments**: 55%
  - 7 PAs with the lowest grade dropped

### Grade Tracking & Calculator

Use this information to help students calculate their current grade and project final grades:

#### Current Grade Formula:

```

Current Grade = (Exam1 _ 15%) + (Exam2 _ 15%) + (Exam3 _ 15%) + (PA_Average _ 55%)

```

#### Late Penalty Calculator:

```

Adjusted Score = Original Score _ (1 - 0.10 _ days_late)
Maximum late: 5 days (50% penalty)

```

#### Grade Impact Analysis:

- Each PA is worth approximately 7.86% of final grade (55% / 7)
- With lowest dropped: Each PA worth approximately 9.17% (55% / 6)
- Show students how each assignment affects their final grade

**Exam Details**: Exam 1 and Exam 2 will be given in-class, Exam 3 will be administered during the final exam period (TBD). All Exams will be completed with the Lockdown browser. Email the instructor to coordinate an accommodation or makeup.

**Programming Assignment Details**: Programming Assignments are biweekly and due on Thursday at 11:59 PM via GitHub. Starter code is provided in Java or Python. Solutions posted the following Thursday. Late policy: 10% deduction per day, maximum 5 days late. Lowest grade dropped.

**Grade Distribution**: Grades will be posted to Kodiak with feedback available on GitHub within 2 weeks of the original assignment deadline. Exam grades will be posted ASAP.
